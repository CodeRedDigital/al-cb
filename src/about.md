<p>After 12 years working in the City as a commercial solicitor and then Director of Human Resources, Caroline moved from education and fundraising and into curating. First gaining a Master's in Modern &amp; Contemporary Art from Christie's Education, she went on to complete an MA in Curating Contemporary Art at the Royal College of Art, London.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Caroline's curatorial practice explores the role of contemporary art in the public realm, with a desire to enrich our urban environment and build community engagement. Working closely with architects, ecologists and other cross-disciplinary professionals, she interrogates how art outside of the gallery can create a space of encounter.</p>
<p>As a firm believer in art’s power to unite in challenging times, many of Caroline’s projects have a social cause at their centre. With experience working on arts and culture projects with charities and social enterprises, Caroline is passionate about how contemporary art and sculpture can engage and benefit a wider community.</p>
<p>As an extension of this, Caroline spends a lot of her time nurturing and mentoring emerging artists. She seeks to mediate the work of emerging artists to a non-art audience, crafting experiences that can be shared and enjoyed.</p>
<p>Currently, Caroline works within the vibrant creative arts hub of Somerset House Exchange.</p>
<p>Caroline sits on the Advisory Board of Kensington + Chelsea Art Week as Curator of Special Projects. This year, despite the COVID pandemic, she helped the committee bring the ten-day festival of arts and culture to life. Curated under the theme of ‘Transformation’ the programme included a public art trail, pop-up ‘galleries’ in shop windows, street murals and a community-led poetry project. Next year, the festival is set to run from 24 June - 4 July 2021 - bigger and better than ever.</p>
<p>In May 2020, Caroline joined the Board of Trustees of Primary Nottingham, an artist-led space which has transformed a Grade II listed former school into a dynamic and outward-looking artistic community. Over 40 artists with a wide range of visual arts practices work in the building alongside independent galleries, design workshops, the Small Food Bakery and an urban garden. With an exciting and accessible public programme, community-focused projects and ambitious commissioning plans, Primary explores new ways for local and international audiences to engage with the wonderful world of contemporary art.</p>
