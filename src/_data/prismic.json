Fragmented Follies was a temporary outdoor commission by Sam Jacob, architect and designer and principal of Sam Jacob Studio, in partnership with Wandsworth Council’s Pump House Gallery, Battersea Park, London. Jacob created a series of striking abstracted sculptures, inspired by the traditional concept of the ‘Folly’, which enlivened and transformed the terrace of the gallery. Created directly from the design language of Battersea Park, the work drew upon the layered architectural and cultural histories of this urban greenspace and its surroundings. ‘Architecture is all about people’ and Jacob designed the work to encourage visitors to interact with the sculptures in any way they chose. Fundamental to our curatorial vision for the project, was this, public accessibility; in defiance of the barriers which often discourage interaction with contemporary sculpture, passers-by were invited to climb on the pieces, eat their lunch off them as though they were tables or simply stop and take in the view! ",
